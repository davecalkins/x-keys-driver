Utility for use with X-keys programmable keyboards (http://www.piengineering.com/xkeys.php).

An XML config file defines the mapping from custom keys on the device to keys transmitted
to the active application.  The app runs with a tray icon and while running maps the
custom key inputs to the configured keys.  This allows setting up a device with a config
file to drive an application.
